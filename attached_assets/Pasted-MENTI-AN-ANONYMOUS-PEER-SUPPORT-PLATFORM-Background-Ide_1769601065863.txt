MENTI – AN ANONYMOUS PEER SUPPORT PLATFORM
Background & Ideation Journey

The idea for this project originated from a simple but deeply human observation: many people struggling with mental health issues hesitate to seek help, not because help doesn’t exist, but because of fear — fear of judgment, exposure, permanence, or being misunderstood.

While professional therapy is essential, there exists a large gap before people reach that stage:

moments of relapse

emotional overwhelm

loneliness

anxiety

addiction triggers

the need to talk right now, without commitment or identity

Existing platforms often fail here because they are:

identity-heavy (profiles, usernames, history)

permanent (messages stored forever)

socially exposed (followers, likes, timelines)

or clinically intimidating

The core question that guided the project was:

What if there existed a safe, anonymous, temporary space where two people could simply talk — or listen — without judgment, history, or identity?

That question became the foundation of MENTI.

Core Idea

MENTI is an anonymous, real-time peer support platform designed primarily for people dealing with:

depression

anxiety

addiction relapse

emotional distress

loneliness

mental fatigue

The platform focuses on human connection before diagnosis, enabling users to either:

talk about what they are going through

listen and support someone else

or be open to either role

There are no profiles, no names, no history, no followers, no stored chats.

Every interaction is:

anonymous

temporary

disposable

consent-driven

The system is designed so that when a conversation ends, it truly ends.

Hackathon Alignment & Problem Fit

The idea strongly aligns with mental-health-focused problem statements such as:

peer-based support systems

relapse prevention

emotion regulation

anonymous group and 1-1 interventions

ethical, non-surveillance-based mental health tech

Rather than diagnosing or replacing therapy, the platform explicitly positions itself as:

a support layer

a bridge before professional help

a human-first, low-barrier entry point

Product Scope (What We Are Building)
Phase 1 (Current Focus – 1-1 Chat)

The first and most critical feature is a 1-to-1 anonymous conversation system.

User Flow (1-1)

User enters the platform (no login)

User chooses 1-1 conversation

User chooses their intent:

Listen

Talk

Both

User is placed into a waiting state

The system matches two compatible users

A single-use session is created

Both users are redirected to:

/room/{sessionId}


Users exchange messages in real time

If either user exits or disconnects:

the session ends

both users are removed

the session is permanently destroyed

There is no reconnection, no chat history, and no reuse of session IDs.

Matching Philosophy

Instead of simplistic random matching, the system uses intent-aware pairing.

Intent Rules

Each user declares a capability:

Choice	Can Talk	Can Listen
Listen	❌	✅
Talk	✅	❌
Both	✅	✅

A match is allowed only if:

at least one person can talk

at least one person can listen

This prevents:

two people who both want to talk

two people who both want to listen

emotionally unproductive sessions

Key Design Principles
1. Backend is the Authority

The frontend never assumes state.
Every critical decision is validated by the backend:

session existence

user membership

session validity

lifecycle transitions

2. Explicit State Machine

Each user exists in exactly one state at all times:

IDLE

WAITING

MATCHED

ACTIVE

ENDED

Illegal transitions are ignored or rejected.

This eliminates:

race conditions

phantom sessions

re-entry bugs

UI desynchronization

3. Single-Use Sessions

Sessions are:

created once

used once

destroyed permanently

Refreshing a page or reopening a tab never resurrects a session.

4. URL-Bound Truth

The route /room/{sessionId} is not cosmetic.
It is a hard reference validated by the backend.
If the session does not exist → access is denied.

5. Privacy by Design

No accounts

No identifiers

No storage of messages

No analytics on content

No replay

Technical Architecture
Frontend

Next.js (App Router)

Client components only where needed

Dumb UI, reactive to backend events

No business logic on client

Backend

Node.js + Socket.IO

Single deployable instance (free-tier friendly)

Real-time event-driven communication

Strict separation between:

socket transport layer

matchmaking engine

state store

Matchmaking Engine

In-memory authoritative store

Deterministic matching

Atomic operations (single event loop)

Redis-ready interface (future scalability)

Why No Database (Yet)

Matchmaking is ephemeral, not persistent

Using a database introduces latency and race complexity

Single-instance in-memory logic is more correct for real-time pairing

The system is intentionally designed so Redis can replace memory later without rewriting logic

What We Built So Far

Full 1-1 anonymous matchmaking system

Intent-aware pairing logic

Single-use session lifecycle

Backend-validated session URLs

Strict disconnect handling

UI with:

waiting state

active chat

session ended state

Clear exit and safety affordances

We also encountered and resolved:

hydration mismatches

socket race conditions

double joins

phantom waiting loops

invalid refresh behavior

backend authority violations

Each fix strengthened the architecture rather than patching symptoms.

Why We Are Building This

Because not everyone needs therapy immediately, but many people need:

to be heard

to not feel alone

to talk without being remembered

to listen and feel useful

to exist without identity for a moment

MENTI is built to respect the emotional fragility of that moment.

What Comes Next (Planned, Not Yet Built)

Group support sessions (AA/NA-style rooms)

Therapist / professional spaces (separate from peer chat)

Content sharing by professionals (videos, posts, blogs)

Scalable backend with Redis (when needed)

Moderation & safety escalation (human-first)

Deployment polish and monitoring

Final Philosophy

This project is not about features.
It is about eliminating undefined behavior in both code and human interaction.

Every design decision — from single-use sessions to backend authority — exists to ensure:

predictability

safety

privacy

emotional respect

MENTI is not finished — but it is correctly designed.
